## Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer and technical leader with 9+ years of experience
across a wide gamut of industries.
I'm based in Silesia, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± and have a particular love for all things web.

My happy place is going deep and getting my hands dirty on complex problems
that solve _real_ issues for _real_ people. I'm a polyglot programmer and
use a vast array of tools to get the job done. Some of my favourite languages
are __Go__, __Ruby__, and __JavaScript__ to name a few.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing video games,
solving one of my many Rubik's Cubes,
or cooking some zesty new dishes with my beautiful fiancÃ©e.
