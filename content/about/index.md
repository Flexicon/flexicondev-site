## Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer and tech lead from the south of Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
with a soft spot for all things web.

My happy place is going deep and getting my hands dirty on complex problems
that solve _real_ issues for _real_ people. I am a polyglot programmer and
never shy away from any tech stack - currently my favourite languages
include __Go__, __Ruby__, and __JavaScript__.

Iâ€™m big on simplicity in design, cracking mediocre, and helping other engineers
level up in their own careers.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me playing video games,
trying to beat my personal best on one of my many Rubikâ€™s Cubes,
or cooking some zesty new dishes with my lovely fiancÃ©.
