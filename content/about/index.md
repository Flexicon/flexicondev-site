## Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer and technical leader with 9+ years of experience
across diverse industries.\
Based in Silesia, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, specializing in web technologies.

I thrive on complex problems that actually matter to users.
My toolkit spans __Go__, __Ruby__, __JavaScript/TypeScript__, and whatever else gets the job done.

When not coding, I'm usually playing video games, reading any weird fiction book I can get my hands on, speedcubing,
or experimenting in the kitchen with my beautiful fiancÃ©e.
