## Background

I’m a full-stack software engineer and technical leader with 9+ years of experience
across diverse industries.
Based in Silesia, Poland 🇵🇱, specializing in web technologies.

I thrive on complex problems that actually matter to users.
My toolkit spans **Go**, **Ruby**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and whatever else
gets the job done.

When not coding, I'm usually playing video games, reading any weird fiction book
I can get my hands on, speedcubing, or experimenting in the kitchen with my
beautiful fiancée.
